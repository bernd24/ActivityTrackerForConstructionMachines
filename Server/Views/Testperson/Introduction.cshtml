<h2>Goals/ Explanation</h2>

<p>The aim of this test is to assess the website in terms of usability, user experience and aesthetics.
In order to achieve this, you will be given a number of tasks to be implemented in the website at the beginning. After completing the tasks, you will be presented with 3 questionnaires.
The first questionnaire aims at evaluating the usability of the application, while the following questionnaire is intended for evaluating the user experience (UX) of the application. The last questionnaire deals with the visual aesthetics of the application.
By analysing the audio recording of the Thinking Loud method, misinterpretations of the application are revealed and can be improved by changing the design or a different arrangement of the elements.
